# Track Matching Challenge

## Data Description
The data represents 2D positions of football players tracked on a pitch, with 3rd dimension of time in the game.

run analyze_matches.py to see the data.



the pitch is shown in pitch.png


the two data files are from video recordings of each side of the pitch, with the overlap region in the middle.


i want you to stich the two plots together. 


PROBLEM 
the videos are slightly out of sync. the degree to which they are are out of sync varies. make algorithm to idenitfy the time difference by matching overlapping lines, between the two csvs. 

then use the this to stich the two plots together, and correct for the time difference.

if you do this in good time you are very likely to secure software engineering position at clann.
